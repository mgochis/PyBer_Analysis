# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
PyBer is interested in understanding their ridesharing services in several different city types; urban, suburban, and rural. The analysis consisted of summarizing the number of rides, drivers, fares and the average fare per ride and driver between January 2019 and May 2019. It was determined that urban cities contributed to most of the rides but had the lowest average fare per ride. These results were consistent across the board with rural cities having the lowest frequency of rides, but the highest average fare per ride. Rural riders were expected to pay nearly $10 more for their rides than urban riders, which is likely attributed to a longer trip distance. Riders in the urban areas paid least per ride at $24.53, suburban riders paid an average of $30.97 per trip, and rural riders paid on average $34.62 per ride. Driver fares were also the highest in rural areas at $55.49 per ride, which is a much more drastic difference of $16.57 per ride in urban areas. This large difference can likely be attributed to higher supply of drivers in urban areas. Also, it’s likely that the trip duration is much shorter in urban areas, so drivers would likely be able to complete two to three trips in the same amount of time as rural trips.

## Results
The figure below shows that urban cities account for 68.4% of PyBer’s total rides. Suburban attributes for a substantially smaller amount rides with 26.3% and rural have the least number of rides with 5.3%. This is representative of the population of these areas. The higher density areas will have more rides than the less dense areas. People that live in urban areas are also less likely to own a vehicle and could rely more on a ride share service like PyBer for their day commute. Urban folks on the other hand are more likely to own a vehicle and may only use ride share services for special occasions.

This next figure shows the percentage of drivers in each city type. Urban cities were expected to have the highest number of drivers which is true in these results. Although, the percentage of drivers in urban cities is 80.9% which is substantially higher than the 68.4% of the total trips in urban cities. Both suburban and rural areas are lacking the appropriate number of drivers. Moving some of these drivers to suburban or urban cities could result in more trips and an increase in fare revenue.

The following figure shows total fare by city type over the span of a four-month period in early 2019. The trends for rural, suburban, and urban cities appear to be consistent over the period. Rural rides do show some spikes towards the end of each month, but there isn’t enough data to conclude if end of month spikes would continue throughout the remainder of the year. Suburban total fares fluctuated the most when comparing it to the other city types. The first large spike towards the end of February also shows for urban and rural areas and can be concluded that during that period there was an increase in overall rides. When comparing all three city types in April there is a decline in rides in suburban and rural areas and urban rides stayed consistent. After the second week we can see a large increase in fares for suburban areas, while both urban and rural declined.

## Summary
PyBer’s rideshare service drastically differs based on city type. The urban cities contributed to most of total trips and total revenue. There may be an opportunity to increase trips in suburban and rural areas by moving some of the drivers in urban areas to other areas as there is an abundance of urban drivers. There is a higher cost of using a ride share in rural and suburban areas which could be contributing to less rides in those areas as well. PyBer may unlock increased trip potential by decreasing the cost in suburban and rural areas. PyBer should also evaluate trip time and distance in these areas which would help understand a little bit more of each area. A fare per distance or fare per time metric would help uncover a lot more information than what is readily available in this dataset.
